# LYB-seq
Scripts for the LYB-seq research project. 

The folder 'FastqProcessor' includes the F# tool for NGS raw data alignment. 

'LYBSeq_Model_TriStructure.m' is the script for the likelihood model, and needs MATLAB, version 2019a or newer, to run. 

'Nupack_subopt.m' is the script to run Nupack within MATLAB. The Nupack software package should be placed within the same folder of this script. 

'Bio1.txt' is an example data to demo the MATLAB script 'LYBSeq_Model_TriStructure.m'. 


Installation guidelines: 

All scripts should be able to run with appropriate environment or software. No additional installation steps needed.
